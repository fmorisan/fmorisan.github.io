      Blockchain Engineer @ MakerDAO, Num Finance
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been working in the software development industry since 2017. My strength is in backend applications, and also smart contract development. I mainly write software in Solidity, Typescript and Python. I also have experience with C, Rust and Java.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also like to tinker with 3D graphics and custom hardware when I get the chance.
