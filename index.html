          Blockchain SWE | CTO @ Viridian Advisor
        </p>
        <p>
          La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina 🇦🇷
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing code since 2011, professionally since 2016.
          I've been working in the blockchain scene since 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          Backend person, infra architect, smart contract dev.
          My preferred backend stack is based on Python, but Typescript and Rust are fine options too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though I'm not a frontend person, I do build interfaces from time to time.
          What's the point of a system no-one can interact with?
        </p>
        <p>
          I sometimes participate in game jams (although anonymously), and tinker with custom hardware
          (mainly rhythm game controllers) when I get the chance.
